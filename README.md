# 🌾 AI-Based Crop Recommendation System

This project predicts the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental conditions like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. It uses machine learning and a Flask-based web interface for easy user interaction.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Machine learning model trained on 2200+ samples
- Takes real-time user input for soil and weather parameters
- Predicts the best crop using a trained classifier
- Clean and simple web UI with Flask
- Displays recommended crop instantly

---

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Flask (Web Framework)
- HTML/CSS (Frontend)
- Pickle (Model serialization)

---

## 🧠 Model Details

- Trained on `Crop_recommendation.csv` dataset
- Used `LabelEncoder` to encode target crop labels
- Final model saved as:
  - `crop_model.pkl`
  - `label_encoder.pkl`
